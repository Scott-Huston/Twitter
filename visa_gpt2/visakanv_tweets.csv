feels like there's probably a very interesting thread to explore here about what Keynes thought about Newton
"the fact that newton sat around making many personal copies of other people's work should not be disappointing, it should be EXCITING

he was human too like the rest of us!!"
"newton would copy stuff over and over. sarah dry, who wrote a book about this, said that the dudes who inherited newton's papers might've been disappointed that he spent so much time making copies

fools!!

everything is a remix!
all learning begins with imitation!"
"newton left behind about 10,000,000 words of notes, writing, papers

5m was religious
1m was alchemy
1m was related to his work as Master of the Mint
3m about math and science"
"this is a fun and appropriate moment to soft-announce that I'm experimenting with launching a digital currency called $GOLDEN via @tryrollhq – nothing serious yet, just a playful toy currency for Friendly Ambitious Nerds. Idk what we'll do with it but the point is to have fun"

"ie, right now if I click anywhere on these search results (1), it all brings me to the same main page (2). It would be so powerful it it brought me to the specific bullet (3), the more granular the better (4)"
"another request: when I search for something, and click on it, I'd like it to bring me to that specific bullet directly. I'm guessing this is probably already a priority bc it would improve navigability tremendously"
"feature request for @RoamResearch: when sharing a public page, would be cool if the title and first line were featured in the snippet. would probably incentivize/increase public note sharing, re-sharing and clickthroughs by some small but not insignificant %"
occurs to me that knowing what to ask google is itself probably a skill – search results here are much closer to what I'm looking for
sometimes I type in the whole query into google in natural language just to see what happens
"btw does anybody know how to make a twitter gpt2 bot + can do it trivially? I don't want to ask anybody to go and study/learn that stuff just to do me a random favor, but if it's trivial for someone, I would dig it"
"it's fun to get lost in it, but it would also be cool if it could be navigated purposefully – like any great city! shit, i'm going to have to start researching how cities work again now, aren't I... 😂 the party never ends 🥳"
"this is a visual of some of my twitter threads. I can mouse-over each tweet and see what the tweet is. I'd like to be able to have an interface where I can clean this up a little, have video notes in it... my brain-city could use some cowpath-paving"
"here's an example of the user behavior i'm talking about – I really like bill wurtz' history of the entire world, but I don't like having to watch the whole video. so I made a sort of timestamped twitter thread of video snippets for reference"
"I suppose the existing configuration is to look for those youtube accounts etc that are putting out great work and share them, become their patrons, etc

for ppl who work on tech: there's a thing that doesn't yet quite exist (I think?) that's roam-adjacent for video/audio notes"
"so when I say ""hire transcribers"", it's not so much ""go and look for stuff that isn't available in the public domain"". the material is there. what we need are energetic and cheerful guides, people who love the material and can introduce it to other people, make it relevant"
"I know there are a bunch of websites that have painstakingly published the entire letters of Van Gogh, of Edgar Allen Poe, etc. so it's not *technically* inaccessible. It's more like, ""socially"" inaccessible"
"imagine if like... da vinci, darwin, etc had public twitter/roam databases that you could trawl around, and you could quote-tweet them at ease. tbh if I was a Person of Means, I would hire modern transcribers to make those things happen. surely some *form* of this exists"
"""the world"" is a big and abstract place, it's easy to get swept up in ideology and grand ideas. I prefer to think of it as a network of relationships. it starts with your relationship with yourself, then those around you, and so on"

"thx! the simplest way I can frame it is: I think of how isolated I was as a child, and I think about all of the kids who are struggling today like I was then, and I try to give them what I didn't have. Eve Ensler said that we heal ourselves when we help others; I agree"
"interesting bits from my twitterfriends graph – its unsurprising that SF, NYC, London, Singapore, Mumbai are major nodes, but it's cool to take those out and see the rest: Dublin, Austin, Berlin, Bangalore, Toronto, Seattle, Chicago, Portland, Edinburgh"
"OK, I think I've gotten everyone! (I try to only fav after I've typed in in) – but I think there's a pretty high chance that I might've derped out or gotten distracted here and there and missed a couple of people, so if you don't see yourself in the list pls @ me again"
(And of course the open secret is that all 200+ people who’ve volunteered to be in this list are good people who I’d recommend following even if they *aren’t* in your city. Optimistic folks who stick their necks out and are willing to be engaged. Be kind + good to each other!)
If you’d like to be added to the list just @ me with your city and I’ll add you! I have a bit of a backlog from yesterday but I’ll try to get to everyone. 🥰🌍🌱
"Thanks everyone for the birthday wishes! 🥰❤️ 

One of my core goals is to make the world a friendlier, kinder, more supportive and nourishing place. One way to do this is to reduce loneliness by introducing good people to each other. 

Find people in your city and follow them!👇🏾"
oh hell yea

"6.5 hours until my 30s

haven't written longform in a while, shall do that"
"but tbh how do I really tell / know for sure? perception is a hell of a drug. one thing I do know is that old video games always look worse than they did when I first played them, and I think that's because my standards & expectations keep getting higher every year"
this seems somewhat higher quality than I ever remember seeing it – and on rewatch it's kind of cute and cool how there's this sort of meta-commentary about the media with all the many screens and channels

"radiohead has been uploading stuff from their archives – album-quality audio, remarkably good video quality from 1994. this seems better than the 2007 glastonbury set I used to watch as a teenager"
OMG this is what I'm looking for!! WTF
"^ this is surely also why old novels are so long &tedious. it only seems tedious now because there's so much else to read. but at the time when you were stuck alone at home in a long winter with only 2 books, reading about every detail of paris's sewers would've been riveting"
there was so little video content for streaming in 2005 that we all watched this for the full 5 minutes and enjoyed it
"I'm annoyed at how difficult it is for me to search ""high quality video of music/bands shot on film"" on youtube. can't figure out what to search for. I just wanna see more of this"
"broad strokes seem to be – if a music video was shot on film, rather than magnetic tape (which was most of them, since it was for TV), there's opportunity to create truly higher quality video. these vids of The Who look like they were filmed yesterday"
this is fantastic
like nobody's been talking about this?? have you ever watched Natalie Imbruglia's Torn in HD??  I now feel compelled to look up all these videos. I can see her lip gloss! I was 7 years old when this video came out!

"what twitter allows us to do – which da vinci, hemingway, darwin, etc were not able to do – is that we can share individual notes in public, take notes on each other's notes and share those – across the entire planet, instantaneously, for free"
"most people probably won't live like this, I know. tweets like these are bat signals for the other note-takers"
"2050: you just take notes from day 1, share them with each other, and there's no need for classes, tests, semesters or college. your notes introduce you to interesting people and opportunities 

the future is already here, just unevenly distributed. I already live like this"

being truthful can get you labeled as untrustworthy

"It can be physically distressing if you really get into it. It’s harrowing how little people care about the truth, and how late. False humility and false confidence are both woven together to create comforting and/or suppressive lies. Wars are fought"
There’s a 2x2 here. I feel like I’ve come up against some version of this several times. Few people think from 1st principles; most tend to pattern-match via appearances. Bullshitters get to screw us over because they disregard content and match the “beats” we like to hear
"It’s kind of related to the idea that politicians have to be liars because the electorate prefers false confidence to sincere doubt. We vote for liars and then complain that they’re liars. We do it to ourselves. Everyone will say they want honesty, but many struggle to face it"
I find myself thinking now about what the incentives are for people with power to be publicly honest about anything. You will be told to protect other people’s feelings (and your brand) by not drawing unnecessary or unflattering attention to yourself. I think this is unfortunate
"These tweets hit different when the follower count reads 20,000 instead of 20. But I am the same person thinking the same thoughts. It’ll hit different again at 200,000 and 2,000,000. There are new concerns and considerations, but I am still also just a curious nerd"
"I don’t want to intimidate people. I love people. But I don’t want to be dishonest, either. I take great pains to be as tactful as I can manage so that I don’t step on anybody’s toes unnecessarily. But power just scares people regardless. Learning is knowledge, knowledge is power"
"I think it’s difficult for people to imagine of what is possible via rigorous examination, journaling, cross-referencing. I try to be very careful to avoid saying things I don’t mean, that I don’t think are true. Over time this compounds into something that intimidates people 😅"
"I’m not interested in “defending” myself, but it’s genuinely very interesting that there are people who think I’m arrogant or deluded for writing openly about myself the same way I write about everything else. I write to think, to explore, to articulate, to learn, to understand"
"when you get precise and clear in your thinking, you start being able to construct thought-lattices that you couldn’t before. funnily, now that I’m starting to learn how to draw, I’m imagining my twitter-web as one of those panoramic drawings

Actually. So I currently have a whole bunch of private lists. I’m thinking it’ll make sense to make a public-facing list. Would you like to be in my public Roam page of list of friends by city? Reply (with your city) and I’ll put your handle in it

friends who’ve met each other thru me:
"just hang out in the replies and chat amicably with other people, over time it’ll happen"
"You don’t actually need to grow a huge twitter yourself, you can just be friends with me and I can introduce you. “Friend of Visa” is an international network of friendly nerds"
"If you can identify your opponent’s entire loop, you can trap them by getting ahead of them and calling their shots. Everyone else watching will think you’re a goddamn wizard. But people are creatures of habit; you mostly just need to observe them over time to discern it"
"Oh I didn’t really explain the “4 points” thing. It’s still kinds vague in my head. It’s a bit like moving goalposts, a bit like reframing the argument. You only need ~4 frames to argue indefinitely. If your 4th frame transitions to your 1st, many won’t even realize it’s a loop"
"the wild card that good-faith actors have is exactly what the movies tell you: friendship. brotherhood. family. they will make sacrifices for each other

bad-faith actors are selfish actors who don’t and can’t trust each other, will cut each other loose. that is their curse"
"I’m guessing it’s because bad faith actors are indifferent to “the truth”, and so they’re willing to just say whatever it takes to distract and mislead people. Good faith actors will persist earnestly, often failing to even notice that the princess is *always* in another castle"
"Because most people are bad at thinking about multiple things at the same time, you only need ~4 points to circle around in order to disorient + trip up most of your opposition. Probably 75% trip up with 3, 85% with 4, 99% with 5. 

Selfish, bad faith actors seem better at this"
"IMO the fundamental killer feature of the internet is that it allows you to interact with people at scale in a way that simply isn’t possible IRL. Sadly, The Apps aren’t actually very optimised for this. Twitter could be even more powerful than it is now"
"what are the guitar pedals of the internet? 

- You can publish anything, tremendous amounts of volume, for free. Write 1000 blogposts make 1000 YouTube videos 

- you can @ anybody on the planet who’s also plugged in. millions of live players right now, countless scenes to join"
"The point of the electric guitar isn’t to be a sorry, apologetic stand-in for the classic. The point is to allow for distortion, for overdrive, for the wah pedal - the point is Jimi Hendrix. The point is to do what could not possibly be done before"
"I agree 100% that even with full VR, an “online classroom” will never replace an IRL one. Just as how an electric guitar will never perfectly sound like a full bodied acoustic. They might look vaguely similar but they are fundamentally different instruments"
"On a tangential note, I really dislike the phrase “online classroom”. I consider myself thoroughly webschooled, & the whole point was to get away from everything about the classroom. Tech innovation is not about copying the old, but about figuring out what’s possible with the new"

"Some will say you have to compartmentalize. That you can’t blame yourself, because it wasn’t really you, it was the context. You weren’t yourself. I have never really been receptive to this perspective. You are always yourself; you just have a limited view of yourself until 👆🏾"
"There are things about peak intensity environments that force people to confront aspects of themselves and each other that they normally wouldn’t even think about. Soldiers returning from war have to live with the memory of what they did in wartime, and how they even enjoyed it"
A thing I remember standing out for me when reading about times of war was how difficult if not impossible it was for intellectuals to remain independent. Their social realities practically disallowed it. Feels like we’re going through something similar now. It’s creepy stuff

"Tedious and silly arguments aren’t necessarily all bad, sometimes they can help you figure things out you can’t quite figure out by yourself. You see?? 😂 The game is infinitely flexible. Don’t get stuck. Unless getting stuck helps. Who knows. Not me"
"People can get into the most tedious and silly arguments over these directives. “You should start your own startup” “no you should work at a big company first” - there are no universal answers, you have to figure out what is right for you based your particular context"
"this is also why each great piece of advice often also has an equally valid counterpoint. “Broaden your horizons, but be focused.” “Be decisive, but take your time.” The right action will vary depending on the context. Takes a lifetime to be discerning"
so it’s not intrinsically bad to be conflicted about things- ah I’m just restating Fitzgerald here
"sometimes when you have 2 beliefs that seem contradictory, it’s not that one belief is correct and one is wrong, but rather they’re each context-dependent, and you haven’t quite precisely figured out what the respective contexts are"

which isn't to say you have to disengage and cocoon yourself in some sort of hyperbaric chamber. those don't really exist anyway. just be mindful of your own body I guess. how's your heart rate? have you been eating and drinking properly? taken any slow deep breaths in a while?
"I just saw some really intense stuff on Twitter. I wanna say, if you feel like you need to log off, you should. Not everyone is well-equipped to handle watching this stuff in almost real time. Take a break, breathe, meditate, talk with your loved ones, take care of yourself first"

which isn't to say you have to disengage and cocoon yourself in some sort of hyperbaric chamber. those don't really exist anyway. just be mindful of your own body I guess. how's your heart rate? have you been eating and drinking properly? taken any slow deep breaths in a while?
"I just saw some really intense stuff on Twitter. I wanna say, if you feel like you need to log off, you should. Not everyone is well-equipped to handle watching this stuff in almost real time. Take a break, breathe, meditate, talk with your loved ones, take care of yourself first"
"This is such a fun format/idea

Maybe I’ll ask my own parents the next time I’m with them"
"I suppose an interesting thing they have in common is they both kinda peaked just before ""real 3D animation"" became a thing. those disney movies are masterworks of hand-drawn illustrations/animations. duke, doom, etc were not ""true 3d"" – quake and half life 1 were"
to think they did all of that without Slack and Asana etc
"random observation, probably a coincidence: the Disney Renaissance (Lion King, Aladdin, Little Mermaid, etc) and the First Age(?) of FPS Games (Doom, Quake, Duke Nukem, Unreal, Half Life) happened around the same time, in the 90s"

how do you explain any of this to children? suddenly realizing I haven't seen my nephews and niece in months
"it's right in the title of his book. ""born a crime"". what does it mean for someone to be born a crime? he was the child of an interracial couple, which was ""not allowed"" at the time. how do you explain that to a child"
"sometimes the thing about racism that bothers me is the failure of basic logic. trevor noah has some great bits about this. like, racism is grotesque, cruel, murderous, horrifying... and it's also weird. incoherent. if you investigate it, it doesn't really make any sense"
metalhead politics
block references actually let me do this
"when I am done this one single page on roam is going to be better than my entire twitter and my entire blog. I can't fucking believe it. all it took was block references. when I edit a referenced block, it changes in the reference, too. my god"
yeah I think the inevitable end result here is that the core 20% of my twitter is going into my public roam
I am feeling my mind experience the joy of being unshackled in real time

"to be more specific, how do you get someone who's obsessed with you to chill tf out and move on with their lives. anybody here have any experience with this"
🤔 what's the playbook for helping someone who's obsessed with a public figure to realize that their obsession is not healthy? or to even realize that they have an obsession in the first place

"it's something I experienced myself when travelling, and I don't think I ever quite read or saw anything that framed it for me in the right way to really resonate with me. being a traveller lets you be a child again in the best way, and people will treat you accordingly"
"been procrastinating on writing something about how nice people can be to international travellers. there's something about seeing and being seen with fresh eyes. it's quite child-like, in a good way – and I suppose every child is an ""international traveller"" new to society"

been reading some Chinese takes on what’s happening in the US. Some of it has the freshness of an outsider’s eyes. It also seems natural for them to compare the protests to Hong Kong- some find it hard to accept/understand/tolerate the looting. I’d point them to Trevor Noah’s vid
going to bed but I’ll get cracking on the others tomorrow!

"Politics is much more complicated, because it’s intertwined with material reality - real people’s lives are affected, with real stakes & consequences. 

Sports is interesting to examine through this lens. How often do you get to make this face/expression in polite company?"
"this is much of what people love about the WWE too. and sports, even. Telegraphed, “larger than life” emotions. It’s theatre! You might say this is what people “like” about politics, too... it’s not about like or dislike, it’s about emotional/psychological arousal, resonance"

"It’s almost a kind of emotional pornography, like or a children’s cartoon for adults. It’s caricature, and it’s well-executed even if you think it’s infantile. It gives people a sort of simplistic starter framework for simulating emotions"
"People then get conflicted about almost everything else- the plot isn’t great, it’s not funny, lots of bits don’t age well, it’s excruciatingly simple - there are dozens of “why Friends is the worst” articles that are all correct. 

Yet people can’t help but love it. This is why:"
This reminds me - I read something? Or did I watch a video? Someone argued compellingly that the reason people love Friends is that all of the actors telegraph their emotional states very clearly. You can watch it with the sound off and “enjoy” it. It’s satisfying at *that* level

"It’s almost a kind of emotional pornography, like or a children’s cartoon for adults. It’s caricature, and it’s well-executed even if you think it’s infantile. It gives people a sort of simplistic starter framework for simulating emotions"
"People then get conflicted about almost everything else- the plot isn’t great, it’s not funny, lots of bits don’t age well, it’s excruciatingly simple - there are dozens of “why Friends is the worst” articles that are all correct. 

Yet people can’t help but love it. This is why:"
This reminds me - I read something? Or did I watch a video? Someone argued compellingly that the reason people love Friends is that all of the actors telegraph their emotional states very clearly. You can watch it with the sound off and “enjoy” it. It’s satisfying at *that* level
I have receipts...

just realized I didn't actually close the loop on the girlfriend story – I married her!
"I try to spend the bulk of my energy going the other way – I try to challenge myself & my peers to do more, do better, grow, and be playful and experimental in learning new things, trying on new ideas, finding points of resonance and agreement, etc

idk how ppl live the other way"
"thinking again about how lots of people really do argue for their limitations, and when confronted with an idea they don't like, really do often go ""how is this wrong"" rather than ""how might this be right"""

it's kind of odd that everyone has eyes
"but yea of course visual art is a whole massive universe and there's room for everybody with every kind of style and inclination. you could spend a lifetime just focusing on photorealistic art and do amazing work there, &or just have fun. I'm biased; I love chaos and want more"
I think of this as the sort of synthesis of the two:
"I don't mean that it's bad to learn something new, it's always good to learn something new. but I also think there's a trap to be wary of when you learn to improve along a certain vector— which is that you might start to forget that actually you can do whatever the hell you want"
"it's interesting to look through the many examples of ""before and after learning to draw with your right brain"" 
– people do become more sensitive to color, shading. this is presented as Obviously Good Progress. while, yes, sure, true... I also kinda wanna push back against it"
"and here is a link to the ebook itself. I'm currently working on v1.1 – if you buy v1.0, you'll get v1.1 (and all subsequent versions) for free. will be raising the price by a couple of dollars with each version update"

I wrote a whole ebook about this. Here's a 1-page summary:
"Sermonposting without shitposting gets you pedestalized, which is dehumanizing 

Shitpost too much and nobody takes you seriously, which is also kind of dehumanizing

You can nerdpost forever quite happily, but it can be a lonely and frustrating experience

The flow is the point"
"These three cores also have ”content extensions”, or “output streams”. Should I explain it? Of course I’m going to explain it, I’m a fucking nerd"
Each core is augmented and reinforced by the other two
"If my core was 100% about seeking peers, I think it would likely trap me in some local optima- I would get caught up in other people’s drama and conflicts, get over-invested, feel overdefined and overburdened by them. It’s important that I have other things going on than friends"
"I can *reposition* myself depending on my mood, the prevailing atmosphere, the landscape and so on. I can play with two “hands” tied behind my back for months on end if required. It’s dynamic, not fixed. I stay interesting because I switch modes when I get bored of myself"
"there are 3 cores. 1 core by itself would fail, because it would be susceptible to attack, overloading, etc. when FRIENDLY is under seige, I typically switch modes to NERD. 90% of malicious actors don’t know how to fight this. Often they literally *call* me nerd. I thank them"

"Idk where I'm going with this, lol. I just think it's interesting to think about. I'd add that if you're feeling ""stuck"" socially, sometimes the best thing you can do is hunt for interestingness rather than try to make up for the social ""deficit"". Sometimes. It's complicated 😅"
"So there was a period of time where How To Navigate Social Reality was the most interesting question on my mind. I studied it, I got good at it, I got rewarded for it, and I eventually got bored of it. It's a very seductive whirlpool you can get lost in forever"
"For me personally, as a nerd, my core engine is the pursuit of interestingness. There *were* times in my life where my incompetence at navigating social reality kept me from achieving my goals (which were typically to seek more interestingness in some form)"
"Social game however is complicated depending on the context and environment. It depends on how you frame it. Status in a social game in a narrowly-defined, closed group of people is kinda zero-sum-ish, unless it rewards interestingness (novelty, nuance)."
"I would say that cool is real social capital, a seemingly intangible characteristic with very tangible consequences. I don't think coolness is zero-sum, I think we can all become more cool, because there's always more interestingness to explore"
one of the core problems of most scenes is that it starts with people who seek interestingness and it ends up overcrowded by people who play the social game. it rhymes quite a bit with the iron law of bureaucracy.
"once you've figured out the base game, you might start experimenting with dissonance. eg one of the base game rules is ""it's uncool to talk about cool"". that's like music or color theory, you can violate it if you know what you're doing"
"I think there are broadly two parts to becoming cool, 1 is to go hunting for interestingness, 2 to play the social game. If you have a critical deficit in one or the other, you'll never be very cool except maybe fleetingly if you're ""lucky"". a fool and his cool are soon parted"
Interesting how the wider mood shifts. Feels like a few days ago everyone was beefing and angry at everything. Now everyone is sorry and soft and bby

"I think of RBG, Jane Goodall and Michael Caine as old, and/but Prince Phillip and Henry Kissinger are a full 10+ years older than them"
going through my iOS notes and found one where I was collecting a list of famous people born each year. it's often kind of surprising to see people who died young juxtaposed against their birth-year-peers who are still alive

It was fascinating to me while I was in SF how early everything closed. I wonder if it’s the weather. In Singapore there’s a good chance some of your friends are having supper somewhere at 2am on any given night. But you can’t walk around here in the afternoon without sweating

"In 2010 when I was a very broke 20 year old I bet S$100 that Germany would beat Serbia in the group stage of the World Cup. They’d just beaten Australia 4-0, seemed like a freebie. They lost 1-0, lmao. I never made a serious bet on sports again 😂 good life lesson to learn at 20"
In February I was willing to bet $500 that the 2020 Olympics would not be cancelled. Thankfully nobody took me up on that bet 😂 but you see how I’m going to remember that one for a long time
"Over 5+ years you build a sort of ledger / leaderboard, a top 10 highlights of best and worst bets, closest calls, etc... it’s actually a remarkably cheap way to manufacture a lot of interesting and meaningful drama"
I know there are like major sites and whatnot re: longbets but that’s too distant. the action should be local to a friend group
"💩: friends should do lots of little bets with each other re: predictions. even if it’s relative low stakes, say in the $10-$50 range. it incentivizes learning. I think I can recall every bet I’ve ever made. If you do it with your peer group watching, it becomes a whole thing"

"even in Singapore I remember as a 18 year old witnessing 12 year old girls (on the bus...?) singing “bouncy bouncy smack smack, ride your train into my track” and thinking “...that’s not right” 😂

it’s an interesting vortex, aging. Millennials really gonna turn into boomers huh"
"I have a relatively high resolution screencap (lol) of my mental state when I was 13. Kids then were totally listening to songs about sex, and singing along, and parodying them. We may not have fully appreciated the finer details but kids aren’t entirely stupid/clueless either"
It’s interesting how everyone is mad in the replies. All That was part of my introduction to American pop culture back in around 2003(?) & this strikes me as very much in the same weird spirit of what they were producing then. I think people forget the dissonant offbeat bits

anyway so that was my childhood
"Imagine Gandalf as a kid, playing with other kids, saying things like “all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us”. And the other kids are like “oy fuck off gandalf you’re so annoying this is why nobody wants to play with you”"
“I wouldn’t know... where to begin”

There are some interesting corollaries here. The foremost of which is this: it’s possible to be so honest that other people deem you untrustworthy. Because most (all?) layers of social reality are built upon the scaffolding of polite fictions
"This was the insight that blew my mind around age 20 when I read 48 Laws of Power. The realisation that my social relations were suffering because people weren’t interpreting my words as honest, likely because they simply weren’t used to dealing with someone like me"
this seems... consequential

trying street fighter 4 after having played third strike was kinda disappointing. but I understand why it had to be that way – it's growing pains. they're changing the whole medium. it's the same reason my video essays currently suck compared to my twitter threads 😂

SF3:3S though... gave us this. I don't think it would've been possible to have had this moment in SF2. And I'm not sure I've heard of any such moment in SF4 or 5. It feels like Third Strike hit a peak in what was possible in 2D fighting games

"what a long ass preamble, lol. point is that i'm not trying to put anybody down, i'm just trying to understand. ok? ok. I think being part of a very large country with hundreds of millions of people is a very weird thing. it seems very unnatural to me"

"I feel like it can't be healthy, though. I feel like it's all connected, the absurd theatrics/WWE nature of political discourse, the widespread loneliness and disengagement, the opoid crisis, anti-anxiety meds, etc etc

caveat again: i am a foreigner and idk wtf i'm talking about"
"and maybe I'm misreading things, maybe it's just a cultural difference in terms of expression. like, different language norms. using lots of exclamation marks when you're not actually exclaiming, etc"

sometimes questions are exploratory and sometimes they are in bad-faith. different people have different general stances and specific tactics/approaches and specific responses. Feel like you could build a whole model of human interaction from these premises
makes sense

at first glance this seems stupid and destructive, but thinking on it more it might actually be sensible and smart"

2. I bought your poems, I like them, hope to read more

3. ""Isn‘t there a false idea though in this?""

CLASSIC MOVE

and also he nerds out about the subject matter

smooth. well played George"
"But now we have a mystery on our hands, lads

how did GWE turn it around? how did he go from receiving a dismissive ""I really wonder at your patience under the circumstances"", to intimate confessions of Poe's feels after his wife's death???"
"AND HE SENT MONEY WITH THE LETTERS

Poe's reply:"
"hold up!!

GWE sent Poe 3 letters over a year before Poe replied

his first letter (pic 2) is just classic reply guy ramble

and... oh my fucking god...

HE DOES A STAN

DEAR POE I SENT YOU ALL THESE LETTERS YOU MUST HAVE GOTTEM"
"the whole letter is quite entertaining and revealing – I copied it out because it wasn't formatted in paragraphs

look at 5 – he's discussing how he replied to some other guy about something... it's exactly like alt twitter. amazing

tempted to read their entire correspondence"
"so I found the context, sure – he was talking about the death of his wife. RIP. But what I wasn't expecting to find was Edgar Allen Poe talking about trying to get at least 500 subscribers for his substack / tinyletter!!!"
"I was curious about the context of the Edgar Allen Poe quote, ""I became insane, with long intervals of horrible sanity."" Turns out it's from a letter to a friend (reply guy?) named George Washington Eveleth, in 1848"
"the trick to being Extremely Online in a way that doesn't involve turning into a shell script is... you have to learn to surf the chaos of other people

it is said that hell is other people; there is a truth to that

what I do is a form of hell-surfing

it's an extreme sport"
that is correct
"it's extremely unlikely that we're going to be able to have a meaningful conversation about this, we've already entered the zone where we're wasting each other's time. you should probably assume I'm mistaken, and move on"
oh we're operating with different frames. yeah this isn't for you
yeah i'm talking about in aggregate. sometimes rivers flow backwards in little eddies
it's good to be suspicious
"I relate to this a lot, actually

wish I had someone like clark's mom

I try to be that person for young nerds"
the most important scene from Man of Steel was when young clark kent had to learn to manage the chaos of his hyper-senses. seldom see/hear people talk about that scene; it really stuck with me

"Every successful referral program eventually gets shut down (PayPal, Dropbox) because eventually the service gets so popular & crosses a critical mass where the cost of referral rewards become terminal while the network effects mean people are hearing about it enough organically"

PS: I don’t think OP is a bad mom or anything like that. In fact I think I would bet that mom’s acknowledgement of the dark humor of her child’s situation is probably a positive thing for the kid. I think it’s  worse if the parent doesn’t acknowledge the suffering
"It’s wild, these pictures really do something to me. I can feel stomach  acid in my throat. My heart is racing. Seeing the kid is literally giving me some kinda PTSD. I gotta go do some meditative deep breathing to shake this out of my system. I’ll be fine. But I wasn’t as a kid"

"The phrase “some people are so poor, all they have is money” is so “edgy” but I honestly think it’s true

I was radicalised from a young age, by artists & poets - to sincerely believe that the only thing that matters is the love and loyalty of your crew"
"And it’s obvious to me that treating people with dignity and respect earns their goodwill, while doing otherwise loses it. I still think super-fondly of my ex-boss years later, and even today I would follow him into a war zone if he asked"
"And you know, importantly, I don’t think of this as “being a better person than other people”. I don’t think I’m a particularly good person, I really don’t. It’s just... math? Logic? It’s obvious to me that the quality of our lives is largely function of our relationships-"
"Still. When I had 200 followers I’d say things like, “accounts with large followings should be responsible and not summon demons by quote-tweeting outrage and dunking for clicks” and so on. And idk if I fit your definition of “large following” but I try to stay true to my values"
"I mean, that seems like it should go without saying, right? And yet it doesn’t; I’ve heard so many shitty stories about things like bosses withholding paychecks or otherwise just making employee life miserable. It seems so dehumanizing. But easy for me to say, with 0 employees"
I think loosely when this game gets interesting is when you can start to afford to hire other people in a substantial way. That’s a significant milestone and it’s something I’ve started to think about a bit more. I strongly believe it’s important to be fair & just when hiring
"I think I will probably make a decent amount of money in my lifetime. It’s not something I *specifically* aspire towards- I mostly would like to not have to worry about my bills, so I can worry about more interesting and exciting things..."
"It’s kind of exciting to be able to see more of the road ahead than I ever did before. Things are only going to get more intense from here on out. More consequential, which means more responsibility. The more I play, the more impact I have on others. It’s sth to keep in mind"
Which isn’t to shit on anybody else’s approach/strategy or coping mechanisms or anything like that. I’m not entirely certain of my own actions either. I’m just thinking out loud + trying to figure out how to do what’s right based on the cards I’ve been dealt
"If I look at the outcomes, I think I’m doing better than I ever have. I have persuaded more people to try to be more thoughtful and kind by demonstrating what it’s like (in my view) to be a nourishing presence, than I ever did by yelling at people for being Bad and Wrong"
"But if I go looking for the differences I *can* find them. I don’t rant & rage as much as I used to; is this because of “respectability politics”? I’d like to think that it’s mostly about becoming more strategic. I’m still mad as hell about injustice, but I take a longer view now"
"I don’t have a lot of money, but I do have significantly more social capital than I did a few years ago, and I’d like to think that it hasn’t changed me. I’d like to think that I use it to serve my values, and that I deploy it towards ends that I see fit"
"I found myself thinking that maybe the only way to really appreciate this properly is to acquire capital yourself, so you can experience the decision matrix from the inside"
"Thinking about a conversation I had with my wife- we were talking about wealth, & power, & how inevitable it seems that most people who acquire capital seem to end up being servants of that capital, rather than masters, & how this picture must surely be biased, and yet..."
(I could be wrong idk. Just guessing)
"The phrase “some people are so poor, all they have is money” is so “edgy” but I honestly think it’s true

I was radicalised from a young age, by artists & poets - to sincerely believe that the only thing that matters is the love and loyalty of your crew"
"And it’s obvious to me that treating people with dignity and respect earns their goodwill, while doing otherwise loses it. I still think super-fondly of my ex-boss years later, and even today I would follow him into a war zone if he asked"
"And you know, importantly, I don’t think of this as “being a better person than other people”. I don’t think I’m a particularly good person, I really don’t. It’s just... math? Logic? It’s obvious to me that the quality of our lives is largely function of our relationships-"
"Still. When I had 200 followers I’d say things like, “accounts with large followings should be responsible and not summon demons by quote-tweeting outrage and dunking for clicks” and so on. And idk if I fit your definition of “large following” but I try to stay true to my values"
"I mean, that seems like it should go without saying, right? And yet it doesn’t; I’ve heard so many shitty stories about things like bosses withholding paychecks or otherwise just making employee life miserable. It seems so dehumanizing. But easy for me to say, with 0 employees"
I think loosely when this game gets interesting is when you can start to afford to hire other people in a substantial way. That’s a significant milestone and it’s something I’ve started to think about a bit more. I strongly believe it’s important to be fair & just when hiring

"I was at my most DFW I was depressed, 2007 and 2015. It’s clear DFW struggled with his brain chemistry. IMO he had a similar issue as JBP - they’re both too solemn in an absurd universe. The answer to this for eg is “lol you can’t, that’s the joke! 😂”"
"Incidentally it was @ryandawidjan who taught me how to do twitter search, which changed my twitter game forever"
"seldom need to change my mind completely on anything anymore, since most of my positions are relatively nuanced and flexible. Behavior-wise I now do more breathwork & make more YouTube videos, which suggests I may have been undervaluing those things before"
"Yes, several. The decisions themselves were not very difficult- they’re correct decisions, so the anticipation is positive. The hard part is withdrawal, sitting with the dark, quiet emptiness in the interim between having activity and finding new activity."
just a bunch of people working from home deciding whether a dude lives or dies

"people are still underutilizing the Internet. Why? Several reasons- undersupply of imagination, courage, first principles thinking. Most people play in a clunky & bloated way. 

But we don’t have to play with most people. We can play with the world’s best"

so if I get mad at the guy, or the specifics of what he said, I would be missing the point – and people do this on twitter every *second*"
"I also don't think that the guy meant to say ""you should become naval"" – it's pretty obvious that he simply meant to point at some representation of success and say ""may you be  successful too"". which is a nice gesture, and I appreciate it"
"artists make stuff up just like children do, they just kept imagining bigger things"
oh wow this is a love letter to imagination. so skilfully executed

some guy DM'd me with something like ""i love your content, I feel like you're gonna be like naval one day""

but I have no interest in being naval, I am here to be visakanv

and if I didn't know that, I might end up wasting years of my life trying to be naval"

the problem with saying things you don't really mean is that after a while your words don't really mean anything

It’s always somebody’s first time 🔥❤️
"A thing I don’t hear a lot of people talk about - probably because I wasn’t paying attention before - is how different people live with different climates. For example, I’ve never experienced a winter in my life"
"when I look back on the hundreds of conversations I’ve had with people, I think the #1 predictor of “will this be a great conversation” for me is “is this person a friendly nerd”. And some famous people (but not all... obviously) are *genuinely* friendly nerds"
"past a certain point, people tweeting “I’m gonna be in Singapore this weekend, what should I do” start getting multiple “you should meet @visakanv!” replies from different people, which i don’t know how to even begin to put a price tag on"
"I was talking with my ex-boss about this once - in a sense I am very lucky to be born and raised in 🇸🇬 rather than in 🇮🇳 or 🇺🇸, because there’s a large volume of international traffic through our city (well not right now...) & it’s easy to stand out vs everyone else"
It is especially entertaining when someone quotes a famous guy at me and I have to resist the urge to say “oh yeah he bought me dinner once and we discussed this at length”
"A wild thing about my life is how I, some nerd from Singapore, have ended up corresponding and even hanging out with some very internationally prominent people over the years. I’m very sensitive to how tacky name-dropping is, so I try avoid talking about it directly..."

anybody recognize this artist? i'm curious to know too. the signature is in the bottom left
consolidating my notes on hormones today
(you can also just be happy with your peers and not care about any of this. a friendly nerd can have a good life without being ambitious.)
"so while it can be exciting and addictive to repeatedly do 2 as much as you can, you have to exercise restraint and do it periodically. the culture and the vibe is the most important thing"
"and the challenge with 2-3 is that there will be good-yet-abrasive people who don't understand the vibe, don't know how to play, etc. any community can only tolerate up to a certain threshold of these people before you have an Eternal September situation"
"1 is too hard + too much work for most people

the challenge with 2 is that you have to avoid getting sucked into the object-level arguments and fights. viral tweets tend to invite people who want to fight. the challenge is to ignore them and focus on the curious people"
"here's a playbook that works, that I occasionally dip into

1. build a body of work (tweet regularly, do thread-webs)

2. periodically reply to viral tweets with a relevant quote-tweet so new people can self-select in

3. onboard those new people into your peer group"

feel free to reply with your book threads
"seeing someone do a decent twitter thread about a book (any book) makes me very likely to follow them. like 70-80% likely, I think"
"more about my process:

so I feel like there's a good chance that I'm going to want to share this idea with people. so I copied it into a blogpost. if I then do find myself sharing it with people, I'll start editing it and make it more presentable"
"other cool thing is – I think ""soften the ground"" is a powerful general principle for all tasks, not just ""I wanna watch this movie"". Instead of feeling vaguely guilty about the stuff on your list, realize that things happen almost naturally once the ground is appropriately soft"
"the more aware I become of the fullness of this process, the less frustrated I become. my subconscious really is smarter and more powerful than me, which is simultaneously amazing and terrifying"
"the most interesting thing about this whole process to me is how little of a say I get in whether or not I'm going to watch something

there is a process that exists through me, of which I am a mere (and often frustrated) servant"
"Now we’re off to the races. Now I can spend a whole day on Miles Davis. I’m looking up what he did in Paris, I’m considering watching the French movie he improvised a soundtrack for. He’ll start popping up in my writing here and there when relevant"
"so at this point I have enough interest to go and read the wikipedia page a little more closely than I usually do – and if there are a couple of bits that hit me, now my interest is aroused. (Importantly, I don't really have much say in this!)"
"I like the idea of jazz, and I appreciate it, but I would be being dishonest if I described myself as ""a jazz guy"". it doesn't shake me up all the way through

I am certainly ""a scenes guy"", though, and I like reading and learning about scenes..."
I think sometime around 2015 I started listening to Kind of Blue on repeat on youtube – and that gave me one entry point. Now I wanna know more about the guy who made the thing I like. But that wasn't enough at the time to make me watch a 2hr documentary
but that's not an insurmountable problem. caring about something intellectually is often a starting point for me to care about it more fundamentally. I just need to get a sense of how it's connected to other things I care about too
"why? because... he's miles davis! he's cool. I wanna be cool. I wanna understand cool. he was a legend, a pioneer. I wanna understand that stuff.

but all of that was happening for me at a rather intellectual layer. I didn't *care* about miles davis, only the idea of him, kinda"
"I notice a thing in my media consumption patterns where sometimes there's something I want to watch or read or learn more about, but it doesn't really happen until something else ""softens the ground"". 

Eg: I've vaguely wanted to learn more about Miles Davis for a few years now"

"Which isn’t to say that it’s *not* the point. There isn’t really a point. Each person gets to decide what the point is, for themselves. When you step back and look at the big picture though, it seems unlikely that each person chose to be where they are from a place of clarity"
"Thinking about this in relation to my experience online, both as a spectator & a participant. I think many people get caught up in a sort of holding pattern where they come to think that the arguing is the point, or that winning is the point. Sometimes explicitly, sometimes not"

For anybody having a rough time: here’s a collection of videos I put together to help me get through rough times ❤️
"I think what I'm arriving at here is gratitude for good art, good writing, made with love, and I'm making an effort to renew my love for it. It is the nourishment that gives me the strength I need to serve others in need, and I'd like to pay it forward"
"which isn't to then say that all media is futile because it can never fully prepare you for reality. to some degree I do feel like I have been moderately well-prepared for our current reality, psychologically, through all the media I have consumed & reflected on over the years"
"a challenging to convey via media – many have tried, to various degrees of success – is what it's like when the entire mood of an entire population shifts. You can read about it but it still hits different when it's your family, friends & your whole world"
"I'm currently passing time by reading about intellectual clubs and scenes throughout history – and I feel like now I have a better ""sense"" for all sorts of things, like reading about the Great Depression, or the World Wars. A sense of the moods, at least"
"I'm not saying ""I now understand what the Black Death was like"". It must have been so much worse in so many ways – imagine not even knowing germ theory, etc. But I think I can say that I understand it a *little* better. It's still a little foreign, but it's not entirely alien"
"when I wrote this tweet, my understanding of the phenomenon was entirely ""intellectualized"". I had to use my imagination, call upon scenes from the media and so on. But it was still something fundamentally foreign to my experience"
"I remember when 9/11 happened (it's my sister's birthday actually, and we were having pizza at home when we saw the news on TV) – and there was some nervousness and uncertainty, and security everywhere was ramped up. I remember the teachers in school were nervous the next day"
"(I mean, every Singaporean serves two years of mandatory conscription, which is a consequence of history – but because everyone does it, and you're kinda-sorta mentally prepared for it from childhood, it's not that big a deal.)"
"One ""good"" thing to come out of these difficult times for me personally is that it's given me a sort of context and affinity for better making sense of history. Until this happened, I never really specifically lived through anything that *really* affected me personally"

"I'm not saying ""I now understand what the Black Death was like"". It must have been so much worse in so many ways – imagine not even knowing germ theory, etc. But I think I can say that I understand it a *little* better. It's still a little foreign, but it's not entirely alien"
"when I wrote this tweet, my understanding of the phenomenon was entirely ""intellectualized"". I had to use my imagination, call upon scenes from the media and so on. But it was still something fundamentally foreign to my experience"
"I remember when 9/11 happened (it's my sister's birthday actually, and we were having pizza at home when we saw the news on TV) – and there was some nervousness and uncertainty, and security everywhere was ramped up. I remember the teachers in school were nervous the next day"
"(I mean, every Singaporean serves two years of mandatory conscription, which is a consequence of history – but because everyone does it, and you're kinda-sorta mentally prepared for it from childhood, it's not that big a deal.)"
"One ""good"" thing to come out of these difficult times for me personally is that it's given me a sort of context and affinity for better making sense of history. Until this happened, I never really specifically lived through anything that *really* affected me personally"

I feel like she would've been right at home on Twitter
"Dorothy Parker with some of her reply guys in NYC: Art, Harpo, Charles and Alexander. They gathered initially as a part of a practical joke, and they ended up meeting for lunch every day throughout the 1920s to gossip, shitpost and collaborate creatively"
starting to notice a pattern here
"""The heady atmosphere of openness, experiment and intellect produced some of the most significant statements in English modernism..."""
"I don't usually think of John Maynard Keynes and Virginia Woolf at the same time, but they were basically twitter mutuals. Shame you can't just search from:keynes woolf to see what their correspondences were like"

Interesting thing about Miles was how he managed to consistently stay at the forefront of the genre for 50 years. I imagine that his disinterest in his popular earlier work must've been a part of how he did it
"he was, of course, also a black man who lived through most of 20th century America. Not overlooking that at all. Just taking note of the power of giving the right tools and encouragement to kids. Trevor Noah has a lovely bit in his book about something similar"
"TIL that Miles Davis was a little bit privileged – his dad was a dentist, his mom was a violinist. His first trumpet was a gift from a family friend, and his first teacher was one of his dad's patients. Always makes me wonder about all the talent that never gets to be nourished"
imagine seeing this in 2015

I'm still thinking about that comment that asked me why I put in so much effort into things when there is no discernable payoff in the near-term. I think it boils down to my faith in people. It's a very direct reflection of my undeniable optimism. But also it's... just... math?
"I want to reflect on past phrases like ""15 minutes of fame"" – sometimes people are dismissive of the present media landscape and say ""15 mins? more like 6 seconds"" – but they seldom acknowledge that artists have more control than ever before. you can charge $$ almost directly"
"around the late 2000s until the early 2010s, I remember there was a lot of ""blogger discourse"". People would argue about whether ""citizen journalists"" were ""legitimate"". I feel like that argument has kind of withered away. As with all disruption, Y doesn't beat X in a fair fight"
"the norms have been such that most people didn't really want all that attention. lots of people, when something goes viral, tend to mute, or lock, sometimes even delete the tweet. but also as we accumulate viral events, opportunists have started to discern opportunity"

"on one hand, it feels like talking about this is not a ""new and exciting"" thing to do; discerning observers and players have been doing it for a decade now. and yet, from where I'm standing, it still seems like there's tremendous opportunity for real artists to play and explore"
"something has been sticking in my mind about how social norms take a while to change in response to technological innovation enabling new behaviors – and i'm thinking about this particularly in the context of social media. twitter, ig, onlyfans, tiktok, all of it"

"really appreciate that my wife trusts me and allows me to do this sort of thing. will have to make it up to her in some creative way, since dining out is not an option... Any suggestions? I guess I could cook for her! It has been a while"
"I feel like I’m walking in a strange liminal space where the world(s) of no rules, my rules, other people’s rules, etc are all overlapping, and all sort of cancelling each other out in a sort of “conjunction of the spheres” eclipse event"
"I feel really good about blowing off all of my worldly commitments to play video games all night for days in a row. I have been missing a couple of self-imposed deadlines, which is a bummer, but I feel like this is restorative and nourishing for me on some greater timescale"
"it’s interesting to think about why “calculative” so often has this negative connotation socially. It tends to be tied up with “selfish”, like a person who spends time figuring out how to screw people over for profit. I spend my time trying to figure out how to help more people"
"I deliberately choose to share this facet of myself about 1% of the time. Just to see what happens. I feel like I wouldn’t be being true to myself if I didn’t. All of it is me. The soft, sensitive guy is also me. The calculating strategist is also me. I am many people."
"Whenever I walk this particular tightrope of talking about how I “really” am, I’m sensitive to the fact that I will lose some people for being “calculative” or “manipulative”. Which is ironic too, because that’s apparently too much honesty for some people to handle 😅"
"People who have witnessed me for a few years might think that I’m this really soft sweetheart. The truth is that I used to frighten people with how cold, clinical and detached I can be. I used to frighten myself too, I think, until I got to know me better"
I often use 😅 when pointing out other people’s errors. The truth is I’m not sweating at all. I do this bc I’ve found that it generally makes people more receptive to owning their mistakes. There’s an irony in how sensitive I am to tone vs how little I care for it personally

"really appreciate that my wife trusts me and allows me to do this sort of thing. will have to make it up to her in some creative way, since dining out is not an option... Any suggestions? I guess I could cook for her! It has been a while"
"I feel like I’m walking in a strange liminal space where the world(s) of no rules, my rules, other people’s rules, etc are all overlapping, and all sort of cancelling each other out in a sort of “conjunction of the spheres” eclipse event"
"I feel really good about blowing off all of my worldly commitments to play video games all night for days in a row. I have been missing a couple of self-imposed deadlines, which is a bummer, but I feel like this is restorative and nourishing for me on some greater timescale"
"it’s interesting to think about why “calculative” so often has this negative connotation socially. It tends to be tied up with “selfish”, like a person who spends time figuring out how to screw people over for profit. I spend my time trying to figure out how to help more people"
"I deliberately choose to share this facet of myself about 1% of the time. Just to see what happens. I feel like I wouldn’t be being true to myself if I didn’t. All of it is me. The soft, sensitive guy is also me. The calculating strategist is also me. I am many people."
"Whenever I walk this particular tightrope of talking about how I “really” am, I’m sensitive to the fact that I will lose some people for being “calculative” or “manipulative”. Which is ironic too, because that’s apparently too much honesty for some people to handle 😅"
"People who have witnessed me for a few years might think that I’m this really soft sweetheart. The truth is that I used to frighten people with how cold, clinical and detached I can be. I used to frighten myself too, I think, until I got to know me better"
I often use 😅 when pointing out other people’s errors. The truth is I’m not sweating at all. I do this bc I’ve found that it generally makes people more receptive to owning their mistakes. There’s an irony in how sensitive I am to tone vs how little I care for it personally
"Aha, I am now personally a victim of overzealous youtube censorship 😂 it’s literally a commentary-free livestream of one of the most popular video games of all time"

I don’t think that happens in this game; this game ends with them leaving Midgar
An incredible cutscene where the gang experiences a Shinra AR propaganda presentation... amazing storytelling... this is one of the coolest cutscenes I have ever seen!!!!
I can’t get over how beautifully they’ve updated everything... I wanna personally applaud everyone who worked on this
Friends helping friends!
Forgot to update this thread 😂 X beat S in the final
I have to stop every so often just to take in how casually cinematic this game gets
"32 hours, we’re coming for you shinra"
30 hours of gameplay before you first see proper sunlight (ie not fake lights from under the plate) - kinda epic and profound
"unless it’s dumb stupid shit that should’ve been written off a long time ago... Exercise Judgement 

personally what I had in mind was Nerdposting"
"Ha, I’m in the fastest 1.2% in the world"

"Also I don’t know what’s going to come out of it. That’s a big part of the fun of it. I’m looking out for interesting opportunities and surprises, and you don’t get those by being overly fixated on some particular outcome"
"A comment on my YouTube channel - I’ll write a proper reply when I get to my computer, maybe even make a whole video about it - but basically “crazy amount of effort” is what it takes to get to anywhere worth going. If you saw my twitter at 800 followers you’d say the same"

An interesting natural experiment that’s emerging on twitter is that me and David (who I consider a dear friend tho we haven’t met) is that we have the same fundamental message and similar goals but slightly different approaches. I’m honestly very grateful for this
"you’ve been hit by,"
"People who are different often seem to spiral into either megalomania or despair, sometimes both - and sometimes people think that this is a function of *being* different, but I think it’s better framed as a function of how other people - cultures - navigate differences"
"I don’t have a “point” to make nearly as much as a reality to contend with + try to faithfully represent. & the reality is that being different is intrinsically kinda isolating because so often people *assume* that you think you’re better than them somehow. (Or worse, sometimes)"
"“Marrying young is a bad idea” - not for me

(In Singapore) “you need paper qualifications to survive in this world!” - no I don’t

“The Internet is a cruel and toxic place” - not for me

(15 years ago) “When you’re an adult you‘ll regret your impulsive decisions” - nope"
I was very much a cockster growing up and I will always be a cockster in my heart
"A Singaporean word I enjoy is “cockster”. Eh, that guy? You can’t take him seriously la, he’s such a cockster. A person who’s a bit of a showboat, a bit of a fool and jester, mostly irresponsible, often charming. Dandelion/Jaskier from The Witcher is a cockster"
"I suppose this is a direct consequence of me operating as a very small, very nimble 1-person operation, such that I fall through the cracks. Technically I do run into some issues with my t-shirt suppliers, for eg, since their staff are not going in to work"
"I never quite know how to properly make sense of mainstream heuristics like “X is bad for business” because historically speaking, any effect that an external event can have on my businesses is still secondary to the fact that I run them"
"I dreamt I had some sort of head/brain injury sickness, very flowers for algernon-esque. Wonder if it’s related to playing through Cloud’s fragmented flashbacks in FF7 😅"
Calling it a night at 22 hours. I’m in a vortex of emotion
I had 10+ years of advance knowledge of this and it still fucking wrecked me ;_;

No those are different stories entirely
"No, it’s a remake of the original, ie the prequel to AC"
"Finally, Airbuster and the Those Who Fight Further theme!! 9hrs in for me"
"Ha they kept the sync thing. Was buttons before, now it’s levers"
Took me 6 hours to get to the second Mako reactor. Probably another hour till the church. Been loving every moment so far
I really can’t believe how good this is. I was so afraid it wouldn’t be good. It’s 5am I’m getting emotional
I’m in Jessie’s parents‘ house looking at her baby pictures...
I’m dying. I’m just dead.
Jessie has a private/personal quest for cloud 😩 these little changes are killing me

Ok so it seems like they’ve basically expanded sector 7 and give you all these little missions - this little girl is asking me to look for her missing cats. This is fucked up if you know what happens... 😩
Looks like FF7 Remake is introducing some Witcher elements
oh damn I got a second sword already. That was fast
Oh interesting you can upgrade individual weapons now
This remake has been consistently surpassing my expectations. It feels so good in every way. I can’t believe this is real
hehehe classic
oh damn they’ve switched stuff up
Just passed the demo
"Hype overwhelming. The sephiroth theme subtleties right from the start, hngh"
Streaming my playthrough of the FF7 remake now!
Oh man :(
"It’s really heartening to watch how Geralt and Yennefer deal with Ciri - it’s almost like they’re her foster parents, as two respective weirdos. The show hasn’t caught up to the game on this - idk if it will - but it’s a really beautiful dynamic"
"Would be funny if you wrote like a tv show or something where a guy wants to be a villain and destroy good things, but accidentally in the process can’t help but make things better for everyone every time"

"I do actually have some skin in this particular game. while I was never *actually* diagnosed with an eating disorder, I think it would have been possible for me to have been diagnosed if I wanted to, or if someone else really wanted to. it's complicated"

but you can't really persuade someone that they're in denial by telling them they're in denial

"Reminds me when people were saying “oh how awfully convenient that the CEO of an electric car company has these perspectives on climate change”, when it’s more like... a guy with those perspectives thought “oh damn, given the climate we probably need electric cars yesterday”"
"I know it’s slightly suspicious that all my trains of thought seem to converge onto my ebook, but the honest answer is that I wrote the ebook precisely because that’s where the trains were converging. Pave the cowpaths etc"
a small group of FANs have a much better shot of doing great work than a large-ish mob of fools
"I’m not saying that one should be entirely indifferent to fools, since mobs of fools can still ruin your life or otherwise make you very miserable. But a focus on fools does seem to invite more fools. I think it’s a better strategy to focus on [drumroll] friendly ambitious nerds"
"A trap that many smart people fall into is The Pit Of Concern For Fools. It stems from a “rational”, market-driven approach. If most people are fools, & you care about the world, surely you should care about fools! Well... maybe. It depends. It can distract you from your process"
"If people were wiser and thought for themselves, then you can actually spew “terrible” advice all the time and there would be no bad consequences. It may even be fun and entertaining, and sometimes even lead to creative surprises. The sad problem is that many people are fools"

reflecting on the most damaging advice I’d ever gotten... it’s never the letter of advice, but *my* reading of it"
"It’s interesting to me that the focus often tends to be “this advice is bad” rather than “if you can’t tell that this advice, like all advice, is tremendously context-dependent, then you’re going to have a bad time”"
"It’s funny to me that I’m still seeing discussions about this almost 10 years later after I first heard it, and I imagine that people are going to keep riffing around it for decades more. I think the broader point is that taking advice literally is more damaging than any advice"
It never occurs to me that people might be drunk-tweeting unless they explicitly say so

"In a way, all of storytelling is about managing and directing the stress of the audience, and eventually resolving it. So like... if I skip out on the stress, I lose the skin in the game. Like watching poker and knowing what people’s hands are, vs not. Ignorance is useful"
"This is clarifying, thx

I don’t “like” the stress either, but as a writer I feel like the stress I feel as a reader/viewer/player is “important” - how I feel when I don’t know what’s going to happen is very precious to me, even if it sucks lol"
"Example of a show that’s like this for me right now is Money Heist. I loved season 1. I think I’m halfway through season 2. And season 4 just got released?? I hate having it left open ended, I want to watch all of it and finish it. But I have no time"
"Oh nah this isn’t it for me, lol. I always want the stories to end. I just want to get to the end properly. My frustration is with having to juggle many balls in my head trying to remember everything since I’m typically watching 10 things at once"
"90% of the time I make it to the end first- the exception I think is when the show/game isn’t that good and I don’t feel compelled to finish it

"there is no advice you can give me that is “damaging”, because at this point I’m smart enough not to mindlessly buy into something because someone else said it

reflecting on the most damaging advice I’d ever gotten... it’s never the letter of advice, but *my* reading of it"
"It’s interesting to me that the focus often tends to be “this advice is bad” rather than “if you can’t tell that this advice, like all advice, is tremendously context-dependent, then you’re going to have a bad time”"
"It’s funny to me that I’m still seeing discussions about this almost 10 years later after I first heard it, and I imagine that people are going to keep riffing around it for decades more. I think the broader point is that taking advice literally is more damaging than any advice"
It never occurs to me that people might be drunk-tweeting unless they explicitly say so

"In a way, all of storytelling is about managing and directing the stress of the audience, and eventually resolving it. So like... if I skip out on the stress, I lose the skin in the game. Like watching poker and knowing what people’s hands are, vs not. Ignorance is useful"
"This is clarifying, thx

I don’t “like” the stress either, but as a writer I feel like the stress I feel as a reader/viewer/player is “important” - how I feel when I don’t know what’s going to happen is very precious to me, even if it sucks lol"
"Example of a show that’s like this for me right now is Money Heist. I loved season 1. I think I’m halfway through season 2. And season 4 just got released?? I hate having it left open ended, I want to watch all of it and finish it. But I have no time"
"Oh nah this isn’t it for me, lol. I always want the stories to end. I just want to get to the end properly. My frustration is with having to juggle many balls in my head trying to remember everything since I’m typically watching 10 things at once"
"90% of the time I make it to the end first- the exception I think is when the show/game isn’t that good and I don’t feel compelled to finish it

when this is going on with multiple things, it starts to take up some real cognitive RAM"

"a while ago my friend Jayne told me about her trip to Iran, and how another friend told her, ""if anyone in Iran offers to let you stay at their place, accept the offer"" – and it actually happened, and she had a wonderful experience. How wild is that? Still thinking about it"
"there are lots of good people everywhere in the world – this fact is oddly underappreciated, probably because so often our understanding of each other is warped by intermediaries"
"though in practice I think it ends up getting nudged out of the core orbit of my central curiosities, so i'll probably get rich in like 10-20 years, indirectly as a partial function of indulging other curiosities"
sometimes i am tempted to get rich out of pure curiosity

I feel like this captures the spirit of society in two lines
"If I hadn’t learned to play, I would have had to turn her down, or lose. But since I learned, I felt like the game rewarded me for it- by letting me have this fun interaction with this character I’ve been growing to like. I’m not sure I’ve ever had such a moment in any other game"
"There’s an actual card game in this universe that the characters play. I initially thought I wasn’t going to bother learning to play it, but somehow I got sucked in eventually. And it was so funny, surprising and real when Priscilla suggested playing while waiting for an ambush"
"Witcher otoh has characters like Djkistra, who seemed to be some sort of ruthless spymaster type, but turns out to be genuinely passionate about building a better life for people, and also has amusingly wholesome anecdotes and relationship advice. All the minor chars grow on you"
"I can think of several games I’ve played that seemed promising - Mass Effect Andromeda for eg had pretty fun combat- but most of the sidequests felt trite & bolted on, and you don’t grow to care about the characters (unforgivable sin in RPGs). Witcher 3 is the opposite of that"
"It’s interesting how slowly this game draws you in. There’s nothing *obviously* remarkable about it- world is nice, navigation & combat is clunky, and the story plods along q slowly. But each story bit lands strongly- the sidequests are actually good"
"startling how identical my motivations are to Montaigne’s

the whole point is to expedite the acquainting of worthy friends"
"The Witcher 3 feels like a really elaborate game of “Thank you, Witcher! But your princess is in another castle!”"
