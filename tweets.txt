@conner_xyz @rescuetime Cool, looking forward to it
@tjrwriting And types of media don't just compete with other forms of media, they compete with all other ways to spend time. Is the value per minute of hanging out with friends going up? Probably not. Working? Maybe

@2davidjames No idea about direct causation, but I believe a lot of mental health issues are associated with sleep issues so I wouldn't be surprised if there was strong association but no causation

@Suhail Just tested, no. Only desktop

@Mat_Sherman Talk shows are generally not recorded like podcasts so they want to always be having a conversation. Podcasts being recorded means listeners can choose to only listen to the best conversations means podcasters focus on quality conversations
@eriktorenberg Interesting thought. I think of "belonging" more like "not below some status threshold within a group". Seems like the positive-sum aspect of status is finding the groups where your strengths are valued.
@CaptainHooked @LambdaSchool Probably the diversity of the student backgrounds. Some have extensive software engineering experience, some hadn't written code before. Some have advanced degrees from prestigious universities, some didn't go to college. Age diversity too. Students from all over the US
@Altimor Not a book, but there is this collection https://t.co/FOVdSccPsl
Meditation is cool, but have you ever tried closing all your tabs?
RT @davidklaing: The main problem with education isn't that we teach the wrong subjects, or that we teach the right ones in the wrong way.â€¦
@johncalhoom You follow a lot of the same people I do. If you have any questions about Lambda, I'd be happy to answer
@patrissimo The idea of reproducible experiments removed the dependence on centralized truth.

Scientists mine truth. New results are in question until verified by other scientists. People using the truth chain can default to the branch with the most work (reproduced experiments)
@brobbs753 @EdLatimore There are a lot of courses for other valuable skills such as engineering, coding, and business. Wouldn't your framework predict that those wouldn't be taught either?
@aaron_etc Good point, I'm not sure. It seems like that probably was true but I think the stigma around therapy has been significantly reduced recently
@LincolnTakahas1 @EdLatimore Hmm, I think social skills would still improve faster with deliberate practice. It's a good point though, maybe just being extraverted is more important than doing it skillfully (and you would probably still improve a lot)
@LincolnTakahas1 @EdLatimore How would someone get that for free?

I strongly suspect that having an expert evaluating strengths/weaknesses, suggesting ways to improve weaknesses or leverage strengths, and giving specific feedback would lead to faster improvement than talking to random people
@to_your_point Ah, great point! My impression is that the biggest markets for social skills are in management training where the learners are basically forced to go and the company pays, or in dating where people get clearer feedback
